# Description

This study utilized data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS 5, 2019-2021, open source) to examine the hypothesis that the presence of the father during pre-
natal care significantly impacts the birth weight of newborns in an Indian sample. A robust regression analysis, which is less sensitive to outliers, was employed. The results indicate that the mother’s report of the father’s presence at antenatal visits is associated with a decrease in the baby’s birth weight by approximately 26.47 grams compared to the reported father’s absence, after controlling for so-
ciodemographic factors. This study suggests that patriarchal social norms and behaviors may contribute to problematic scenarios characterized by low levels of social well-being and threats to the lives of women and children.

This work was independently prepared by me for the data analysis competition named ABCD Hackathon 2024, organized by The Atlas of Behavior Change in Development in collaboration with the Centre for Social and Behaviour Change. All data were extracted from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS 5, 2019-2021) and pertain to the population of India. The data cleaning and analysis were performed by me using the statistical software Stata. The writing and execution of this report in LaTeX are also solely my work.
